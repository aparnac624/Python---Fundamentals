# Python-Fundamentals

This project contains Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts:

1. Printing strings, including names and emails.
2. Using escape sequences in print statements.
3. Performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
4. Printing a sequence of numbers with basic python concepts.
5. Printing special characters and formatted strings.
6. Using escape sequences like newlines, tabs, and backspaces.
7. Declaring variables, type conversion, and performing calculations.
8. Calculating the number of minutes in a year using variables.
9. Taking user input and displaying a greeting message.
10. Converting currency from pounds to dollars based on user input.

Each script demonstrates fundamental Python syntax and operations useful for beginners.


Questions included in this project are :
1. Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com  
2. Write Python code that prints your name, student number and email address using escape sequences. An example runs of the program: Bob ST1001 bob@gmail.com  
3. Write Python code that add, subtract, multiply and divide the two numbers. You can use the two numbers 14 and 7. An example run of the program: 14 + 7 = 21 14 * 7 = 98 14 – 7 = 7 14 / 7 = 2 
4. Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps. An example runs of the program: 1 2 3 4 5 
5. Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen: An example runs of the program: "SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas "IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". 
6. Practice and check the output print("python is an \"awesome\" language.") print("python\n\t2023") print('I\'m from Entri.\b') print("\65") print("\x65") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n") print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b") print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b") 
7. Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum? num=23 textnum="57" decimal=98.3 
8. calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time. print a statement that describes what your code does also. Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values (hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour 
9. Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting. An example runs of the program: Please enter you name: Tony Hi Tony, welcome to Python programming :) 
10. Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount in pounds (£) and the program calculates and converts an amount in dollar ($) An example runs of the program: Please enter amount in pounds: XXX £ XXX are $ XXX
